# interpolation_decimation_matlab
Multi-rate systems are systems that have one or two systems operating at different sample rates. The sample rate can either increase (interpolate) or decrease(decimate). In specifics, interpolation is the process of inserting additional samples, while decimation is the reverse process of the former.
